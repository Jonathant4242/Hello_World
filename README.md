# Hello World (Chile Edition 🇨🇱)

This is a simple “Hello World” project for my personal software portfolio at **BYU–Idaho**.

While working on this assignment, I’m on vacation in **Chile** until **2026-01-16**, so the message includes a quick personal note along with the classic Hello World output.

## What it does
- Displays **"Hello World!"**
- Displays a short message: **Greetings from Chile 🇨🇱 — I’m on vacation until 2026-01-16.**
